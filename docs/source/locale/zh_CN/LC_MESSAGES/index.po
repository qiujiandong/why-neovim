"Hi, everyone! I mainly work with C/C++/Python development, and I have "
"been using `VS Code <https://code.visualstudio.com>`_ for a long time. I "

" easy to get started with, and is powerful enough to meet most work "
"requirements."

"As I was preparing to write these thoughts, `Neovim 0.11 "
"<https://github.com/neovim/neovim/releases/tag/v0.11.0>`_ had just been "

"<https://neovim.io/roadmap>`_ for the upcoming 0.12 version, which is "
"being referred to as \"\\ **The year of Nvim OOTB**\\ \" (Out of the "
"Box). Future versions of Neovim will become even more user-friendly and "
"ready to use from the start. I believe that in the near future, Neovim "
"will gain even more recognition and recommendations from developers."
